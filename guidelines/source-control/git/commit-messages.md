# Git Commit Messages

This document is meant to outline the approach used by developer AJC to writing commit messages. The goal is to provide a consistent and informative way to communicate changes to the project, and demonstrate the developers personal understanding and thought process to this aspect of the development process.

## Doc vs Code Commits

There are usually two kinds of commits that occur, changes to project documentation, and changes to source code. Source code changes tend to break down into other hierarchal categories that are more complex, there is especially a difference between 'feature' and 'bugfix' commits, but these two types of changes tend to be the umbrella under which you can expect to categorize most of your commits.

### Documentation Commits

For the most part, documentation change commits require less complexity. It's good to name the document that was changed and possibly the section, especially if the document is large but well organized using markup.

### Source Code Commits
