# Git Commit Messages

## Doc vs Code Commits

There are usually two kinds of commits that occur, changes to project documentation, and changes to source code. Source code changes tend to break down into other hierarchal categories that are more complex, there is especially a difference between 'feature' and 'bugfix' commits, but these two types of changes tend to be the umbrella under which you can expect to categorize most of your commits.

### Documentation Commits

### Source Code Commits
