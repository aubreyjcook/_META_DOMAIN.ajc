# Tagging System Guidelines

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a clear and structured approach to tagging repositories within my GitHub profile. This tagging system is designed to help organize projects, indicate their purpose, and provide context at a glance.

## Overview

The tagging system uses prefixes and suffixes in repository names to convey important information about the project's intent, phase, and technology. This method ensures consistent naming conventions across all repositories, making it easier to manage and understand the context of each project.

## Tagging Conventions

### Prefixes

- **dev_**: Used for serious development projects that are part of a specific initiative to create an application or feature.
  - Example: `dev_ProjectName.ajc`

- **sandbox_**: Used for experimental projects, prototypes, or less organized code.
  - Example: `sandbox_ProjectName.ajc`

- **edu_** (or **college_** or **school_**): Used for academic projects related to coursework or research.
  - Example: `edu_ProjectName.ajc`

- **priv_**: Used for personal repositories that contain private or sensitive information.
  - Example: `priv_ProjectName.ajc`

- **_META_**: Used for repositories that contain meta-information about projects or repositories. Typically does not contain code but rather data written in plain-text compatible syntax such as Markdown. Begins with an underscore to indicate its special purpose and priority.
  - Example: 
    - `_META_ProjectName.ajc`
    - `_META_Git-RepoDocs.ajc`

### Suffixes

- **.ajc**: Indicates personal creation, a unique identifier for repositories created by me.
  - Example: `ProjectName.ajc`

- **.org**: Indicates a repository associated with a non-profit organization or community project.
  - Example: `ProjectName.org`

### Combined Tags

- Repositories can use a combination of prefixes and suffixes to provide a detailed context.
  - Example: `dev_WebsiteOptimization.ajc`
  - Example: `sandbox_DatabaseExperiments.ajc`
  - Example: `edu_DataScienceProject.ajc`
  - Example: `priv_PersonalDiary.ajc`

### Additional Tags

- **html**: Indicates the use of HTML or web technologies.
  - Example: `priv_ProjectName.html.ajc`

## Examples

### Development Projects

- **dev_algorithm-implementations.ajc**: A comprehensive sandbox for algorithm implementations in multiple programming languages.

### Experimental Projects

- **sandbox_WebOptimizations.ajc**: A sandbox for experimenting with various web optimization techniques.

### Academic Projects

- **college_DataScienceProject.ajc**: A project created for a data science course.

### Personal Projects

- **priv_PersonalDiary.ajc**: A private repository for personal diary entries.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these tagging conventions, all repositories will maintain a consistent and informative naming structure. This system facilitates better project management, easier navigation, and a clearer understanding of the context and purpose of each repository.
