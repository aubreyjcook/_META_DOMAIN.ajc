# ChatGPT Notes: Plain Text Notation Guidelines

To effectively organize notes in plain text while maintaining an intuitive structure, you can adopt several methods and resources that have been developed by others. Here are some approaches:

1. Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's widely used because it’s easy to learn and can be converted to HTML and other formats. While it does include some formatting, it remains highly readable as plain text.

Example:

markdown

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- **Bold Text**
- *Italic Text*
- `Code`

1. Ordered List Item 1
2. Ordered List Item 2

2. RestructuredText (reST)

RestructuredText is another lightweight markup language. It’s used extensively in Python documentation and is designed for technical documentation.

Example:

rst

Header 1
========

Header 2
--------

**Bold Text**

*Italic Text*

- List Item 1
- List Item 2

1. Ordered Item 1
2. Ordered Item 2

`Link <http://example.com>`_

3. Textile

Textile is a lightweight markup language originally developed to provide a simple way to format text. It's used in various content management systems and documentation tools.

Example:

textile

h1. Header 1

h2. Header 2

*Bold Text*

_Italic Text_

# List Item 1
# List Item 2

"Link":http://example.com

4. Org-mode (Emacs)

Org-mode is a powerful system for organizing notes, planning, and authoring in Emacs. It uses plain text but provides advanced features for managing tasks and projects.

Example:

org

* Header 1
** Header 2

*bold text*
/italic text/

- List Item 1
- List Item 2

5. Custom Plain Text Notation

You can create your own system by defining rules and structures that suit your needs. Here’s an example of a custom notation:

Example:

plaintext

# Header 1
## Header 2

**Bold Text**

*Italic Text*

- List Item 1
- List Item 2

1. Ordered Item 1
2. Ordered Item 2

[Link](http://example.com)

Tips for Custom Notation:

    Headers: Use # or other symbols for headers. Define a consistent hierarchy.
    Emphasis: Use symbols like ** for bold and * for italic.
    Lists: Use - or * for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists.
    Links: Use a consistent format for links, like [Link](URL).
    Code: Use backticks or indentations for code blocks.
