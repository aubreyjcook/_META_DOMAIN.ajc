# Next.JS

## Overview

Next.js is a React framework.

## Project-specific Stacks

While Next.js itself is based on a specific stack, the nature of Next allows it to be used with various pseudo-stacks of it's own. This is due to the wide compatibility of many frameworks and libraries that have been built to be used with Next.js and other site generators like it. This also has to do with the relative poratibility of Next instances themselves, which can be hosted or configured to work with many custom platforms.
