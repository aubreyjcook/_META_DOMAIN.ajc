### ChatGPT Initial Project Outline Discussion

It's typical that a project starts with a discussion or outline of the project's scope, goals, and initial tasks. This discussion can be carried out with ChatGPT, other LLMs, or team members to brainstorm ideas and outline the project's initial structure. An additional initial documentation file is should be included alongside the main readme that logs this information. The log should be formatted to be as clear and concise as possible, outlining the key points discussed and the initial project structure.
