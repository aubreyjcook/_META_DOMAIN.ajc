## ChatGPT Overview

ChatGPT is a LLM (Large Language Model) that can be used for a variety of tasks, including generating text, answering questions, summarizing text, and more. It is based on the GPT-3 architecture and is trained on a diverse range of internet text.

## Helpful Practices for using ChatGPT

This section outlines some helpful practices for using ChatGPT effectively.

### Conversation Naming

The current interface for ChatGPT as of 10-2024 is fairly limited for managing multiple conversations.

A convention for helping with ChatGPT conversations is to name them on a standardized basis.

One example I have developed is to use the name of the subject followed by intention statement. The issue is that the conversation name is very limited, so I try to maintain using only about 2-5 words.

A convention I am following for especially development tasks, is to state the technology or project name, followed by something like 'research' or 'implementation'. As using ChatGPT for research tends to result in a longer conversation, but using it for implementation requires more concise responses.

For example 'aubreyjcook.next' is my personal website, which I have a separate conversation for research and implementation.

'aubreyjcook.next research'
'aubreyjcook.next implementation'
