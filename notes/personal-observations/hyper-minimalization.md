# Hyper Minimalization Techniques in Web Development

## Overview

Hyper-minimalization is a term used by developer AJC to describe a different architectural strategy to web development that is specifically defined in contrast to modern web dev approaches, especially JavaScript: This is mainly defined in the context of the impact to web performance with respect to the resources and work required by browsers to render web pages and applications.

Modern web development practices have evolved over time as a sequence of trends that are a reaction to the initial state of the web, which was primarily a document-centric approach. Web pages and early web apps were mostly analogous to printed documents. HTML was the basis of this approach, and CSS was introduced to provide styling and layout capabilities. JavaScript was added to provide interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. This type of web development is what will be referred to as "traditional" or "classic" web development in this document.

Modern web development practices arose as the complexity of the feature sets within web sites and apps increased. This complexity introduced performance degradation and bottlenecks when using traditional web development practices. Examples of this include complext techniques to offset the loading of resources, such as lazy loading, code splitting, and other techniques to reduce the initial load time of web pages and apps. These techniques are necessary to offset the performance impact of the complexity of modern web apps.

However, this complex approach is self-perpetuating.
