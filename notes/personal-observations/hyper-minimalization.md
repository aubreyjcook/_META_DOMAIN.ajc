# Hyper Minimalization Techniques in Web Development

## Overview

Hyper-minimalization is a term used by developer AJC to describe a different architectural strategy to web development that is specifically defined in contrast to modern web dev approaches, especially JavaScript: This is mainly defined in the context of the impact to web performance with respect to the resources and work required by browsers to render web pages and applications.

Modern web development practices have evolved over time as a sequence of trends that are a reaction to the initial state of the web, which was primarily a document-centric approach. Web pages and early web apps were mostly analogous to printed documents. HTML was the basis of this approach, and CSS was introduced to provide styling and layout capabilities. JavaScript was added to provide interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. This type of web development is what will be referred to as "traditional" or "classic" web development in this document.

Modern web development practices arose as the complexity of the feature sets within web sites and apps increased. This complexity introduced performance degradation and bottlenecks when using traditional web development practices. Examples of this include complext techniques to offset the loading of resources, such as lazy loading, code splitting, and other techniques to reduce the initial load time of web pages and apps. These techniques are necessary to offset the performance impact of the complexity of modern web apps.

However, this complex approach is self-perpetuating. The more complex the web app, the more resources are required to offset the performance impact of the complexity. This leads to a cycle of increasing complexity and increasing resource requirements.

To be clear, hyper-minimalizationation techniques are not a suggestion that modern web development practices are inferior or unnecessary in certain projects, but rather an approach that seeks to minimize the usage of modern techniques when they are not necessary within a project, or where traditional techniques would be more performant. Nevertheless, hyper-minimalization is meant to be an aggressive approach, and seeks to forgo or remove modern techniques wherever it is more effective to do so.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

There are three main advantages to hyper-minimalization:

1. **Performance**: Hyper-minimalization seeks to reduce the amount of resources required to render a web page or app. This can lead to faster load times and better performance on lower-end devices or slower network connections.

2. **Simplicity**: Hyper-minimalization seeks to reduce the complexity of a web page or app. This can lead to simpler codebases that are easier to maintain and debug.

3. **Ease of maintenance**: Hyper-minimalization seeks to reduce the amount of code required to render a web page or app. This can lead to codebases that are easier to maintain and update.

### Disadvantages

There are also disadvantages to hyper-minimalization:
