# Maladaptive Patterns of Development

This is a description of patterns in software development that have potentially disruptive implications to the industry, or to developers themselves.

**Disclaimer**

The description of these patterns is not meant to be an explicit condemnation of the usage of these patterns or developers who utilize them. Many of these patterns arise out of a specific context or need to address a problem that is valid, but the implications of the pattern in other contexts makes them maladaptive. It's explicit to understand that any technology or approach to technological development can be used in a way that is beneficial or detrimental, and that the context of the usage of these patterns is what determines their value.

## Patterns

### Hyper-Modernization

The trend of using ever expanding techniques and technologies when existing techniques and technologies can sufficiently provide problem resolutions if applied correctly.

### Framework Overload

The tendency for complex frameworks to heavily inform the development processes of modern development practices, resulting in a cascade of extreme learning depth that is beyond the reasonable expectation that regular humans can be expected to learn at a reasonable rate. Especially when the application of a framework provides minimal additional problem resolutions in comparison to the complexity of applying it.

### Artificial Intelligence Hysteria

A trend of aggressive premature adoption and implementation of AI technologies to resolve issues associated mainly with profitability rather than efficiency or effectiveness, often without conducting sufficient research or understanding of how the scope of a potential problem is not best solved by AI. **Especially when using human labor is more effective or significantly less expensive.** This is often motivated by a fundamental misunderstanding of the usage and capabilities of AI, and a desperate anxiety of being left behind due to the rapid development of AI technologies and becoming a non-competitive entity in the market.

### Intellectual Property

The influence of the pursuit of intellectual property within the space of software development, when doing so is done primarily with the intent of developing competitive advantage rather than to protect a technology from misuse or to foster the potential of a technology.
