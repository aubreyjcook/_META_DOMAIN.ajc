# Learning and Personal Development Overview

This is an overview of techniques or observations in learning and personal development, especially as they apply to acting as a software developer. Some topics here may be entirely unrelated to development, but are fundamental to developing stronger intuitive skills and understanding concepts that apply to software development.

Humans are not machines, rationality is not the primary driver of human behavior, and the brain is not a computer. While capable of rational thought, humans are primarily emotional beings. The decision to apply rational thought to our decisions is often first driven through the executive functions of the brain primed by an emotional response. The brain generally seeks understanding through a combination of intuition and pattern recognition. The brain is not 'programmed' but it is 'trained' through experience and repetition. The brain is not a computer, but it is a complex system that can be modeled and understood through the lens of computer science.

Since humans are not generally rational, and are poorly inefficient at computational tasks, it is better for humans to offload the work of computation and extreme logical processing to machines.
